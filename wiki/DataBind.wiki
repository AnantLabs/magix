#summary Explains how DataBinding works in Magix

= Introduction =

DataBinding means that you have dynamically fetched Data, which you'd like properties of your Widgets to become 'bound' towards. 

= Details =

Imagine you had 3 Meta Objects in your Storage, all of type 'Prospect', and all of these objects containing these items;

  * Email
  * Name
  * State

Then if you were using an Action that somehow maps to the _Magix.MetaObjects.GetMetaObjects_ Event to fetch your Objects, such as for instance the _Magix.Demo.GetRatingObjects_ does, you would bind your Repeater with this Expression;

{DataSource[Objects]}

And your items inside of this Repeater like this;

{[Properties][Email][Value].Value}
...to bind towards the Email value of your Objects...

{[Properties][Name][Value].Value}
...to bind towards the Name value of your Objects...

etc...
